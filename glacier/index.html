            refrigerators in a melting world, we joined you all on the Voyage
            Great Thaw, a mission to visit the last glacier on Earth before it
            deconstructs. Before it becomes itself, only wetter. Before its blue
            cathedral monolith humbles, exhales, and crashes into the velvet
            sea...</em

          "The meat of it, I believe, is to see that some things might really
          <em>not</em>
          change. We were born swimming in primordial soup, the captain reminded
          me, the thick borscht of life — with which we are still basically
          surrounding ourselves, the water that was our origin-stew wrapped
          around us in a layer of skin. Water plays a long game, she said,
          drawing on the word like a cigarette. When the seas rise, and here I
          noted her certainty — when the seas rise, the brief miracle of form
          will de-crystallize, will fall to the scaled expanse of formlessness,
          un-sculpture, joined in pure potentiality. Like laying your body down
          on a piano, I thought, all the notes at once, undifferentiated
          harmonies. Like the dinosaurs and the glaciers, she said, we will
          melt."

          The audience became ship-mates on the boat, and they wrote letters to the last glacier that were read aloud and posted throughout the space.
