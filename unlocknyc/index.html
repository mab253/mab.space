          Unlock NYC is a women-run tech collective, building tools to make the
          housing search process transparent, fair, and free from
          discrimination. Everyday, New Yorkers are denied the chance to apply
          for a home simply because they receive government assistance to pay
          for rent. Saying "no vouchers, no Section 8" etc. is illegal in New
          York - and we work with voucher holders and housing rights advocates
          to create digital tools that make it easier to recognize, record, and
          report this discrimination.

          Since 2019, we've built a know-your-rights chatbot, launched an
          encrypted phone call tool for recording and reporting this kind of
          discrimination, and we maintain a secure database for storing and
          sending reports to advocates. We're cultivating a user base, building
          a city-wide voucher discrimination dataset, and we've analyzed our
          current findings and written a
          <a href="https://weunlock.nyc/soi-report/" target="_blank">report</a>
          on source of income discrimination along with the member-led
          organization Neighbors Together. See Unlock NYC's

          Unlock's earliest iteration was called "Landlord Watch." From the
          early days of research, interviews, and recruiting collaborators, to
          weathering what happened to city agencies during 2020 (😱), to
          prototyping, testing, and launching multiple web tools, we remain
          committed to centering lived experience as expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerns of data security, accessibility, and doing right by our users
          have been paramount during the iterative design and build process.
